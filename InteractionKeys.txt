Here is our final implementation of the Music Editor.

The main arguments still do not have a particular order they need to be written
in, so long as they are valid inputs. Interacting with the controller is as follows:

These keys work on their own:
 - ......... use the arrow keys to traverse the piece
 - "space" . used for play/pause
 - "home" .. returns the view to the beginning of the piece
 - "end" ... returns the view to the end of the piece
These keys work as switches:
 - "a" ..... toggles the addNote mode
 - "w" ..... toggles the addNote mode, for percussion notes
 - "s" ..... toggles the removeNote mode
 - "d" ..... toggles the changeNoteStart mode
 - "f" ..... toggles the changeNoteEnd mode
 - "q" ..... toggles the moveNote mode
 - "e" ..... toggles the changeCurBeat mode, to pick where the music begins
 - "v" ..... toggles the expandBoard mode
By using these switches, mouse clicks are used to interact with the musical data.
These keys:
 - "t" ..... when in the expandBoard mode, will add the next highest octave
 - "g" ..... when in the expandBoard mode, will add the next lowest octave
 - "b" ..... when in the expandBoard mode, will add 8 more beats to the piece
also work in tandem with the "v" key, much like the other toggle keys with the
mouse. For all modes that are mutating existing notes, the first click will be
used to select the note, and the second will provide the mutation of the data.

Sometimes the clicking can be buggy, so it may take two or three clicks on occasion
to perform the desired operation. While the program is running, all interactions
with the program are printed into the console, so if there is ever trouble the user
should watch the outputs to help guide their interactions.
